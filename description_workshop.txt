It allows you to move the camera along a predefined path, lock the camera to a fixed point 
or make the camera follow an NPC, Item or Projectile.

This mod has been split of from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562953970]"Better Zoom"[/url] mod. If you're looking for a mod to just zoom in/out more, check it out.

[h2] How to use [/h2]
To use this mod you need to enter [b]Editor mode[/b] by pressing the Keybind, which you have to set first.
In [b]Editor mode[/b], you can freely move the camera with W, A, S or D and zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.
The "Show View Range" button will draw a box to show what the player will see at 100% zoom.

You'll also see the UI at the bottom of the screen in [b]Editor mode[/b].

You can select between Bézier and (Catmul-Rom) Spline curves.
The difference is that Bézier curves will create a smooth curve, where the points of the curve don't have to hit all control points.
In comparison, a Spline curve will go through all control points.

After selecting a curve, start drawing by clicking and dragging the mouse to the desired location. 
When you're done placing, go back to [b]Select mode[/b], by clicking on the currently selected curve type
and move the control points to create the curve you want.
